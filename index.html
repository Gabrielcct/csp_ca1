            <p>
                Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 council areas. Historically part of the county of Midlothian ,it is located in Lothian on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. Edinburgh is Scotland's second-most populous city and the seventh-most
                populous city in the United Kingdom. s Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament and the highest courts in Scotland. The city's Palace
                of Holyroodhouse is the official residence of the monarch in Scotland. The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scots law, literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. It is the second-largest
                financial centre in the United Kingdom, and the city's historical and cultural attractions have made it the UK's second-most visited tourist destination attracting 4.9 million visits, including 2.4 million from overseas in 2018. Edinburgh's
                official population estimates are 488,050 (mid-2016) for the Edinburgh locality,518,500 (mid-2019) for the City of Edinburgh council area, and 1,339,380 (2014) for the wider city region. Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh and
                South East Scotland city region comprising East Lothian, Edinburgh, Fife, Midlothian, Scottish Borders and West Lothian. The city is the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. It is home to national cultural institutions
                such as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is placed 16th in the QS World University Rankings
                for 2022. The city is also known for the Edinburgh International Festival and the Fringe, the latter being the world's largest annual international arts festival. Historic sites in Edinburgh include Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse,
                the churches of St. Giles, Greyfriars and the Canongate, and the extensive Georgian New Town built in the 18th/19th centuries. Edinburgh's Old Town and New Town together are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which has been managed
                by Edinburgh World Heritage since 1999.

                <h3>Historical</h3>
                <p>A census by the Edinburgh presbytery in 1592 recorded a population of 8,003 adults spread equally north and south of the High Street which runs along the spine of the ridge sloping down from the Castle.[127] In the 18th and 19th centuries,
                    the population expanded rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831, primarily due to migration from rural areas.[93]: 9  As the population grew, problems of overcrowding in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped tenements
                    that lined the present day Royal Mile and the Cowgate, were exacerbated.[93]: 9  Poor sanitary arrangements resulted in a high incidence of disease,[93]: 9  with outbreaks of cholera occurring in 1832, 1848 and 1866.[128]</p>
                <p>The construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on
                    land to the north. [129] Expansion southwards from the Old Town saw more tenements being built in the 19th century, giving rise to Victorian suburbs such as Dalry, Newington, Marchmont and Bruntsfield.[129]</p>
                <p>Early 20th-century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style.
                    Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh's population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central
                    London.[130]
                </p>
                <p>From the early to mid 20th century, the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as Dumbiedykes, Leith, and Fountainbridge, led to the creation of new estates such as Stenhouse and Saughton,
                    Craigmillar and Niddrie, Pilton and Muirhouse, Piershill, and Sighthill.[131]</p>

                <p>Edinburgh has the strongest economy of any city in the United Kingdom outside London and the highest percentage of professionals in the UK with 43% of the population holding a degree-level or professional qualification.[163] According
                    to the Centre for International Competitiveness, it is the most competitive large city in the United Kingdom.[164] It also has the highest gross value added per employee of any city in the UK outside London, measuring £57,594 in 2010.[165]
                    It was named European Best Large City of the Future for Foreign Direct Investment and Best Large City for Foreign Direct Investment Strategy in the Financial Times fDi magazine awards 2012/13.</p>
                <p>In the 19th century, Edinburgh's economy was known for banking and insurance, publishing and printing, and brewing and distilling. Today, its economy is based mainly on financial services, scientific research, higher education, and tourism.[166]
                    In March 2010, unemployment in Edinburgh was comparatively low at 3.6%, and it remains consistently below the Scottish average of 4.5%.[167] Edinburgh is the second most visited city by foreign visitors in the UK after London.</p>
                <p>Banking has been a mainstay of the Edinburgh economy for over 300 years, since the Bank of Scotland was established by an act of the Scottish Parliament in 1695. Today, the financial services industry, with its particularly strong insurance
                    and investment sectors, and underpinned by Edinburgh-based firms such as Scottish Widows and Standard Life Aberdeen, accounts for the city being the UK's second financial centre after London and Europe's fourth in terms of equity assets.[168]
                    The NatWest Group (formerly Royal Bank of Scotland Group) opened new global headquarters at Gogarburn in the west of the city in October 2005. The city is home to the headquarters of Bank of Scotland, Sainsbury's Bank,[169] Tesco Bank,[170]
                    and TSB Bank.</p>
                <p>Tourism is also an important element in the city's economy. As a World Heritage Site, tourists visit historical sites such as Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Old and New Towns. Their numbers are augmented in August
                    each year during the Edinburgh Festivals, which attracts 4.4 million visitors,[167] and generates over £100m for the local economy.[171]</p>
                <p>As the centre of Scotland's government and legal system, the public sector plays a central role in Edinburgh's economy. Many departments of the Scottish Government are in the city. Other major employers include NHS Scotland and local government
                    administration.[166] When the £1.3bn Edinburgh & South East Scotland City Region Deal was signed in 2018, the region's Gross Value Added (GVA) contribution to the Scottish economy was cited as £33bn, or 33% of the country's output.
                    But the Deal's partners noted that prosperity was not evenly spread across the city region, citing 22.4% of children living in poverty and a shortage of affordable housing.[172]</p>

                <h3>Local government</h3>
                <p>Following local government reorganisation in 1996, the City of Edinburgh Council constitutes one of the 32 council areas of Scotland.[207] Like all other local authorities of Scotland, the council has powers over most matters of local
                    administration such as housing, planning, local transport, parks, economic development and regeneration.[208] The council comprises 58 elected councillors, returned from 17 multi-member electoral wards in the city.[209] Following the
                    2007 City of Edinburgh Council election the incumbent Labour Party lost majority control of the council after 23 years to a Liberal Democrat/SNP coalition.[210] The 2012 City of Edinburgh Council election saw a Scottish Labour/SNP
                    coalition. The 2017 City of Edinburgh Council election, saw a continuation of this administration, but with the SNP as the largest party.</p>
                <p>The city's coat of arms was registered by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1732.[211]</p>

                <p>Edinburgh, like all of Scotland, is represented in the Scottish Parliament, situated in the Holyrood area of the city. For electoral purposes, the city is divided into six constituencies which, along with 3 seats outside of the city, form
                    part of the Lothian region.[212] Each constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional MSPs to produce a result based on a form of
                    proportional representation.[212]</p>
                <p>As of the 2016 election, the Scottish National Party have three MSPs: Ash Denham for Edinburgh Eastern, Ben Macpherson for Edinburgh Northern and Leith and Gordon MacDonald for Edinburgh Pentlands constituencies. Alex Cole-Hamilton of
                    the Scottish Liberal Democrats represents Edinburgh Western, Daniel Johnson of the Scottish Labour Party represents Edinburgh Southern constituency, and former Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, Ruth Davidson represents the
                    Edinburgh Central constituency.</p>
                <p>In addition, the city is also represented by seven regional MSPs representing the Lothian electoral region: The Conservatives have three regional MSPs: Jeremy Balfour, Miles Briggs and Gordon Lindhurst, Labour have two regional MSPs: Sarah
                    Boyack and Neil Findlay, Scottish Greens have one regional MSP: Alison Johnstone and there is one independent MSP: Andy Wightman (elected as a Scottish Green).</p>
